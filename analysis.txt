# Data Analysis

## Dataset
I used the Iris dataset from `sklearn`, which includes different measurements of iris flowers.

## What I Compared
- Sepal length
- Petal length

## What I Found
After creating histograms and a scatter plot, I noticed a clear positive relationship between sepal length and petal length.  
As sepal length increases, petal length usually increases too.

## Conclusion
The results show that sepal length and petal length are strongly related.
